To setup the right version of the SDK, please do following:

Check out module "CRMGadget-SDK" from CVS like you checked out this project here.
Then look into "change_flex_sdk" to follow the screenshots.

You do not need to keek the SDK-Project open for it to work,
as it only contains the binaries to work with.
